404 by Rob Manuel - April 2018

A slideshow of images that displays them randomly - hopefully
resized to use screen space AND should look ok on mobile 

When I say "ok" I mean a hot 90s mess. But one that uses Jquery.

Preloads the next images so having them ordered makes sense
as then I can show images 1, 2 and preload 3 and 4.
Then 40.4 seconds later show images 3, 4 and onto the next.

My route for doing this is to bung the images into a big array
then adding array to self a few times and then randomising.

This is to allow the same images to randomly come up occasionally
Instead of just once per cycle.
